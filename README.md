# Tour_Guide
### Description
A Python Project named as Tour Guide. The main idea of this Project is to create a Python Application (Destop based) similar to Google Map using less resources and Simple implementation. 
### Key Features
* Find Current Location automatically.
* Find your Given Location.
* Plot these locations on the Geographical Map.
* Find and Display the Venues the given Location.
* Find and Display the Venues your Current Location.
* Search specific category like Food, Universities, Health Centere around.
* Search Trending venues around you or your Given Location.
* Can tell you at what distance every Venue is located from you or your selected Location.
* Venues are Plotted on Folium Map as Circle markers
* The Colour of Circle marker Denotes the Rating of the Venues 
  > Mark Red for Low 
  > Mark Green for Good 
  > Dark Green for Very Good 
  ### Motive 
 Key motivation behind developing this Project is to facilitate the folks to find the Venues of Interests around. Explore your Surrounding through a different angle.
 ### Methodology and Working
 I developed this Project using Folium(API), Foursquare, Geopcoder, Pandas and Selenium.
 For finding a location we find the cordinates of the location Using Gecoder or selenium for scrapping from https://mycurrentlocation.net/.
 For Plotting these Cordinated i used Folium.
 For Venues and their details extraction. I used Foursquare API.
 The Programing Concepts i Implemented are as Follows.
 JSON Normalization,JSON parsing , Data Formatting , Data Cleaning , Data Handling, Data Scrapping, Data Visualization, APIs, Web Scrapping, Exception Handling,
 Recursion, Control Structure,
### Usage
I would glad if you contribute to my work and take one step further my idea. 
To use 
- Download the Python Notebook in Jupyter.
- Install all the nessarry Modules.
- Place the chrome drivers in the same Directory 
- Run
